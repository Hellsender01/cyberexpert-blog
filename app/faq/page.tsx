                        <AccordionContent>
                        To get started in ethical hacking, begin by acquiring a strong foundation in three key areas. First, develop a solid understanding of operating systems, particularly Windows and Linux. Second, learn about networking concepts and various protocols. Lastly, familiarize yourself with a programming language, with Python being a recommended choice. Once you have a grasp on these fundamentals, you can delve into hacking concepts such as vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and other related topics.
